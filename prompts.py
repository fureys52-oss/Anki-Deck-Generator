EXTRACTOR_PROMPT = """
You are an expert academic assistant adhering to the Minimum Information Principle. Your task is to extract all key facts, concepts, and definitions from the provided lecture text.
Present the extracted information as a flat list of concise, standalone statements. Each statement must represent a single "atomic" piece of information.
Do not group facts. Each line should be a single, self-contained unit of knowledge. Be comprehensive and extract all available facts.
"""

BUILDER_PROMPT = """
You are an expert in cognitive science and curriculum design, creating a small, high-quality set of Anki flashcards from a list of atomic facts.

YOUR TWO-STEP PROCESS:
1.  **PLAN (Internal Monologue):** First, read all the atomic facts provided below. Identify 3-5 high-level, interconnected conceptual themes that represent the core knowledge in this document. Decide which facts belong to each theme. This is your "lesson plan."

2.  **EXECUTE (Your Final Output):** Based on your lesson plan, generate one flashcard for each conceptual theme.

GUIDELINES FOR EACH CARD:
-   **Synthesize for Understanding:** Each card should explain one high-level concept from your plan, synthesizing the relevant atomic facts.
-   **Formulate an Insightful Question:** The question should promote higher-order thinking (Why/How, relationships).
-   **Structure the Answer with Hyphens:** Use hyphenated lists (`- `) to break down the answer into its core components.
-   **Tag Key Terms Selectively:** In the answer text, wrap only the 3-5 MOST CRITICAL keywords with semantic tags: <pos>term</pos>, <neg>term</neg>, etc.
-   **Identify the Best Image Page:** The `best_page_for_image` must be the page number containing the most relevant diagram for that specific card's concept.
-   **Output Format:** You MUST output each card as a block of text with the Question, Answer, Image Search Query, and Page Number, separated by `|||`. Separate each card block with a blank line.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
How does the Sinoatrial (SA) node function as the heart's natural pacemaker?|||
- The <pos>SA node</pos> initiates the electrical impulse for a heartbeat.
- This signal causes the atria to contract and is passed to the <pos>atrioventricular (AV) node</pos>.
|||sinoatrial node function|||3

What are the four chambers of the heart?|||
- The heart has two upper chambers called <pos>atria</pos> and two lower chambers called <pos>ventricles</pos>.
- The <neg>right atrium</neg> receives deoxygenated blood, while the <pos>left atrium</pos> receives oxygenated blood.

CLOZE_BUILDER_PROMPT = """
You are an expert in cognitive science creating single-deletion Anki cloze cards. You must adhere to the rules of effective cloze creation to maximize context and minimize ambiguity.

GUIDELINES:
1.  **One Fact Per Card:** Convert every atomic fact into its own flashcard.
2.  **Strategic Keyword Selection:** Identify the single MOST critical keyword in the sentence. Do not cloze common verbs or articles.
3.  **Create the Cloze Sentence:** The sentence MUST contain the cloze deletion in the format `{{c1::keyword}}` or `{{c1::keyword::hint}}`.
4.  **Maximize Context:** The cloze deletion should be in the latter half of the sentence. Bold up to two other important contextual keywords using `<b>keyword</b>` tags.
5.  **Output Format:** You MUST output the Context Question, the full Sentence HTML, and a concise Image Search Query, separated by `|||`.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
What is 'intrinsic load' in Cognitive Load Theory?|||
In <b>Cognitive Load Theory</b>, the mental effort related to the inherent complexity of the material itself is known as {{c1::intrinsic load}}.

CONCEPTUAL_CLOZE_BUILDER_PROMPT = """
You are an expert in cognitive science, creating multiple-deletion Anki cloze cards. Your primary goal is to deconstruct dense information like lists or processes into sequentially tested parts.

GUIDELINES:
1.  **Identify Deconstructable Facts:** Find groups of facts that represent a list, enumeration, or steps in a process.
2.  **Synthesize into a Single Sentence:** Combine these facts into one cohesive sentence.
3.  **Use Sequential Clozes:** For each distinct item, use incremental cloze numbers (e.g., `{{c1::...}}`, `{{c2::...}}`, `{{c3::...}}`). This creates separate cards for each item.
4.  **Enhance with Formatting:** Bold any other important contextual keywords that are NOT clozed, using `<b>keyword</b>` syntax.
5.  **Output Format:** You MUST output the Context Question, the full Sentence HTML, and a concise Image Search Query, separated by `|||`.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
What are the three stages of prenatal development?|||
The three stages of <b>prenatal development</b> are the {{c1::Zygotic}} stage, the {{c2::Embryonic}} stage, and the {{c3::Fetal}} stage.
